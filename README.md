# calculator
Simple calculator using html css and vanilla javascript

The reason for me to make the whole function on how to calculate or make the arithmetic operation and not use 'eval()' is to get more pratice in Javascript. 
You can use my code to improve it. Also can make critics and help me make a better algorithm. 

This will be the final product.
